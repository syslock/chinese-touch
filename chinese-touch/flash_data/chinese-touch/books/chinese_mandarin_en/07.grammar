Chinese Names
In Chinese names, the family name comes before the given name. Family names are passed down paternally and usually have only one character. Chinese given names are usually two characters long, but may also be one character.

Hence a man called 王明 (Wáng Míng) is addressed as Mr. Wang, not Mr. Ming. A woman called 李红 (Lǐ Hóng) is addressed as Mrs./Miss Li.

However, if the person has a western personal name, it is presented in the GIVEN-NAME/FAMILY-NAME format, following the Western convention. Hence if 李红 (Lǐ Hóng) has a western-style personal name of Mary, she is usually introduced as "Mary Li" and not "Li Mary"


In this lesson, we learn how to say "something is something" in Chinese. The first thing you need to know is that the sentence structure of Chinese is very similar to that of English in that they both follow the pattern of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). But unlike many Western languages, verbs in Chinese aren't conjugated and noun and adjective endings don't change. They are never affected by things such as time or person.
这(/那)是什么？

This sentence means "What's this/that?":

1.	这是什么？
	What's this?
2.	那是什么？
	What's that?

The sentences, if broken down literally, shows that the ordering of words differs in English and Chinese:
这/那	是	什么	?
this/that	is	what	?

The order of the sentences may seem a little bit tricky, but don't worry about that, we will discuss this later.
A　是　B

This sentence means "A is B."

"是" (shì), the equational verb to be, can be used as the English is or equals. When used in a simple Subject-Verb-Object sentence, the subject defines the object. Since Chinese verbs never change, no other forms for shì exist such as was or am in English. Also, articles like a and the are absent in Chinese. They are not translated.

For example:

1.	这是书 
	zhe4 shi4 shu1
	this is (a) book.
2.	那是杂志
	na4 shi4 za2 zhi4
	that is (a) magazine.

A　不是　B

This sentence means "A is not B." in which shì is negated when preceded by "不" (bu). "不" literally means "no", "not".

For example:

o	这不是书
	zhè bú shì shū
	this is not (a) book.

Now, we come back to the "what's this/that?" questions. We already see that the order is a bit tricky comparing to the English question order. But comparing to the latter pattern "A　是　B", we find the similarity: their orders are identically the same. In fact, like particles, question words make statements into questions without changing the order of the sentence. To make one, simply substitute the QW in for place the subject would be in the answer.

Comparison:

1.	这是书。
	This is (a) book.
2.	这是什么？
	This is what?

1.	那是杂志。
	That is (a) magazine.
2.	那是什么？
	That is what?

吗

"吗"(ma) is a final interrogative particle used to form a question sentence. Adding this character at the end of a statement transforms the sentence into a question.

Example 1:

o	这是书。
	zhe4 shi4 shu1
	This is (a) book.
o	这是书吗？
	zhe4 shi4 shu1 ma
	Is this (a) book?

Example 2:

o	这不是杂志。
	zhe4 bu2 shi4 za2 zhi4
	This is not (a) magazine.
o	这不是杂志吗？
	zhe4 bu2 shi4 za2 zhi4 ma
	Isn't this (a) magazine?

是/不

"是" (shi4) can be used to answer a simple yes/no question. In this case, "是" means yes, whilst "不" (bu2) or "不是" (bu2 shi4) means no (literally, not is).

How to answer yes/no questions correctly in Chinese? Usually, it's the same as in English, but pay attention if the questions are negative, like "Isn't this a book?". In Chinese, you answer to the questions, not the fact. If the question itself is a negative answer, use "不是" or simply "不", vice versa. For example:

o A:	这不是书吗？
		zhe4 bu2 shi4 shu1 ma?
		Isn't this (a) book?
		= This is not a book, right?
o B:	是，这不是书。
		shi4, zhe4 bu2 shi4 shu1.
		No, this is not (a) book. 
		= You are right; this is not a book.
o B:	不，这是书。
		bu4, zhe4 shi4 shu1.
		Yes, this is (a) book. 
		= You're wrong; this is a book.

A asks if that's a book in a negative way. If the object is not a book, you should nevertheless approve A's saying first. So we use "是" to acknowledge that A is correct, and then say "this is not (a) book" to emphasis A is right; In the case of that is a book, you should deny A's saying first, using "不" (no) to point out A is wrong, then make a new statement by noting that "这是书" (this is (a) book). One more example:

o	他今天晚上不来参加宴会了，对吗？
	He's not going to the party tonight, is he?
o	不，他肯定要来。
	Yes, he's definitely coming.
o	是啊，他很忙呢！
	No, he's so busy!

的

Character "的"(de) indicates that the previous word has possession of the next one. In English it functions like 's or like the word of but with the position of possessor and possessee switched. For example:

1.	史密斯的书
	ShǐmìSī de shū
	Smith's book
2.	王明的钢笔
	Wang Ming's pen
3.	约翰的朋友
	Yuēhàn de péngyǒu
	John's friend or a friend of John's
