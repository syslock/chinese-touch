Chinese Touch is a language learning tool for Nintendo DS with a focus on Chinese. Acknowledging the difficulties of designing a complete course that fulfills requirements of different learners and because of the ongoing learning efforts of its designers Chinese Touch follows the idea of user driven extensibility. Thus it is meant more as a generic tool to make your own learning docs easily portable and more accessable. Just convert your existing texts and word lists into a collection of utf8-encoded plain text files and you can practice reading and writing right on your DS the way you want. Apart from that the precompiled version includes a beginners guide to Chinese (Mandarin) from wikibooks.org.

The current implementation basicly features two modes:

1. The word list browser displays single chinese words along with pinyin and translation which you can show or hide individually to practice memorization. You can use the touchscreen to practice writing or just complete hidden information and control yourself afterwards. 

2. The text browser displays longer texts which you can easily scroll using the touchscreen. You can tap on unknown characters and display context-matching word list entries on the upper screen. Tap again and display any word containing the character. This makes reading texts containing many unknown characters much less time consuming and less frustrating, whereas it might have a negative influence on word memorization.

Chinese Touch organizes your learning stuff in a hierarchy of books and lessons, while every lesson can contain a list of new words, a grammar text, a chinese text and plain textual excercises. Your lessons are available from the lesson menu that Chinese Touch boots right into.
