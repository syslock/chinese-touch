Chinese Touch is a language learning tool for Nintendo DS with a focus on 
Chinese. In contrast to many other applications (there are not that many for 
Nintendo DS anyway) Chinese Touch does not try to provide a complete course for 
a specific level of language skill, but is meant more as a generic tool to make 
your own learning docs easily portable and more accessable for your individual 
needs. Many learners, especially tech-savvy ones, already transcribe word lists 
or even text from their text books to the computer (try it, its a good training 
already) to take advantage of dictionary programs, flashcard applications and so 
on or even use digital sources in the first place. So all you have to do is to 
convert your digitally available texts and word lists into a collection of UTF8-
encoded plain text files and copy them onto to your flash memory cart into the 
directory structure Chinese Touch understands. That way Chinese Touch can assist
you in practicing reading and writing and memorizing words right on your DS 
wherever you are, whenever you have a couple of minutes of spare time, using 
your prefered learning materials. Apart from that the ready-to-use program 
archive available from the downloads section already includes a beginners guide 
to Chinese (Mandarin) from wikibooks.org. Just extract its contents to your 
flash memory cart and give it a try.

Please check the project wiki for a basic introduction to the features currently
implemented in Chinese Touch.

Also checkout your copy of the source code from subversion if interested.
