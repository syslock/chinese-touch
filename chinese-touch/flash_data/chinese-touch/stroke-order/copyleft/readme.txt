The Commons Stroke Order Project 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Commons Stroke Order Project aims to create a complete set of high quality  
and free illustrations to clearly show the stroke orders of Han characters 
(hanzi, kanji, kana, hantu, and hanja). The project was started as there was 
none like it in terms of quality and it seems that it is the only one working 
on three standards of Han character stroke order; ROC, PRC, and Japan.

Note: The Chinese Touch package is currently limited to black and white images
in PRC standard (*-bw.png), wich make the majority of the stroke order images 
available by the time of the release of this package.

Who benefits from these images?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Commons Stroke Order Project is especially useful as a graphic database, 
both for other Wikimedia projects and free databases. All the files 
are uploaded under clear, Unicode (UTF-8) encoded filenames.

Note: As Chinese Touch is limited to FAT accessed through libfat, which seem to 
impose restrictions on filenames, the original filenames where converted from 
UTF-8 to a hexadecimal representation of fixed width 16bit Unicode code points, 
e.g. u5929-bw.png instead of 天-bw.png.

As of January 2007, HanDeDict uses about one thousand of our free *-bw.png 
images.

Wikibookians use these for the Chinese and b:Japanese wikibooks at the English 
Wikibooks, the Chinese wikibook at the Polish Wikibooks, and the Chinese 
wikibook at the Italian Wikibooks.

Wikipedians use this work at pages such as fr:Tracé d'un sinogramme and 
en:Stroke_order#Types of strokes

Wiktionarians are using it on pages such as wikt:fr:Wiktionary, 
wikt:la:Wiktionary, and wikt:de:Wiktionary.
