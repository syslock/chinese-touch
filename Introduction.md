# A short Introduction to Chinese Touch #

Chinese Touch organizes your learning stuff in a hierarchy of books and lessons, while every lesson can contain a list of new words, a grammar text, a chinese text and plain textual excercises. Your lessons are available from the lesson menu that Chinese Touch boots right into.

Selecting the lessons new words or a dynamic word list will fire up the word list browser. It displays single chinese words along with pinyin and translation which you can show or hide individually to practice memorization. You can use the touchscreen to practice writing or just complete hidden information and control yourself afterwards.

A new feature in version 1.1 is the difficulty rating. You can specify a difficulty for any word in the database or change the rating at a later time. Your rating will be stored permanently and will make the word appear in the corresponding dynamic word lists accessable from the lesson menu. Choosing a dynamic word list from a lesson entry will generate a list of words from the current book up to that lesson with the specified rating. Choosing a dynamic word list from a book entry will generate a list of words from the complete book. Every dynamic word list is automatically ordered by the time of the last presentation of the words, while words not been seen a long time are shown first. Thus you get the basic functionality of a flashcard system with multiple (4) boxes. You should go through the most difficult box most often and try to reduce the number of words stored therein as much as possible, by changing the difficulty rating of words you think you have learned to a lower level. The same way you can change the difficulty to a higher level if you forgot a word.

When you choose grammar, text or exercises from a lesson entry, then the text browser will be started. The text browser displays longer texts which you can easily scroll using the touchscreen similar to the way you navigate in the lesson menu. You can tap on unknown characters and display context-matching word list entries on the upper screen. Tap again and display any word containing the character. This makes reading texts containing many unknown characters much less time consuming and less frustrating. Besides that the user interface of the text browser is similar to the word list browser. Use the arrow buttons to browse the list of matching words, hide or show portions of the word entry and rate the difficulty of the currently shown word.

The ability to process and render arbitrary texts using Truetype fonts opens the possibility to create/convert lessons for different languages than Chinese. At least in theory. Here is an example of a japanese text rendered using the default CJK font in Chinese Touch:
